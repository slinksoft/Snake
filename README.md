# Snake
Concept demo of a recreation of the classic Snake game. This code applies everything I learned in my first programming class at FIU (COP 2210), including

- Arrays, 2D arrays, and array lists
- Creating custom classes
- Calling classes from one class to another
- making custom methods/functions
- Accessors and mutatora
- Switch statements
- Drawing GUI objects to a canvas such as a WinForm (JFRAME in java)

and much more. The concept demo features

- Original snake movements
- random spawning of food when eaten (and also checks if it spawns on top of the snake to give it another random spawn location)
- Borders
- Score display

Fully coded in C#.
